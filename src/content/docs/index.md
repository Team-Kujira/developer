Welcome to the official Kujira documentation portal. Here you will find all the technical documentation you need to get started with building on Kujira!

We are very excited about the prospect of you building with us, and are honored to be under consideration as your future blockchain home. At Kuijra, we are giving it our all to build a sustainable crypto ecosystem. Realizing that vision is only possible if more motivated people like you join us and contribute to our shared ambition.

We want to make your decision process as simple as possible, so we’ve organized all of the resources you might need into this developer portal.

Of course, there’s always the slight chance we have overlooked something. As a budding blockchain, we have plenty of time and energy to reach out to involved projects and developers. If you have a question that our shared resources fail to clarify, please don't hesitate to [reach out to us!](/getting-help). We recommend joining our social channels to stay up to date with the latest technical developments.

We look forward to seeing what you build on Kujira and hope you will join us on our journey to build a sustainable crypto ecosystem!
